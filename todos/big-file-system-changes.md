## 🔧 Implementation Commands

```bash
# Create new directory structure
mkdir -p imports/ui/components
mkdir -p imports/ui/pages
mkdir -p imports/ui/styles
mkdir -p imports/ui/desktop/components
mkdir -p imports/ui/desktop/pages
mkdir -p imports/ui/desktop/styles

# Example moves (use git mv to preserve history)
git mv imports/ui/mobile/components/ImageUpload.jsx imports/ui/components/
git mv imports/ui/mobile/pages/SignIn.jsx imports/ui/pages/
git mv imports/ui/mobile/styles/SignIn.js imports/ui/styles/

# Update imports in files (manual process)
# Find and replace import paths across codebase
```

## 📝 Example Commit Messages

```bash
refactor(ui): create shared components directory structure

- Create imports/ui/components for shared components
- Create imports/ui/pages for shared pages
- Create imports/ui/styles for shared styles
- Create imports/ui/desktop for desktop-specific components

refactor(ui/components): move ImageUpload to shared components

- Move ImageUpload.jsx from mobile/components to ui/components
- Move ImageUpload.js from mobile/styles to ui/styles
- Update imports in all files using ImageUpload
- Component now available for both desktop and mobile use

refactor(ui/pages): move authentication pages to shared location

- Move SignIn.jsx from mobile/pages to ui/pages
- Move SignUp.jsx from mobile/pages to ui/pages
- Move ForgotPassword.jsx from mobile/pages to ui/pages
- Update corresponding style files and imports
- Authentication flow now consistent across platforms
```

## 💡 Implementation Notes

### Import Path Updates

When moving files, update imports throughout the codebase:

```javascript
// Before
import ImageUpload from '../mobile/components/ImageUpload';

// After
import ImageUpload from '../components/ImageUpload';
```

### Component Wrapper Pattern

For platform-specific styling of shared components:

```javascript
// mobile/components/MobileButton.jsx
import Button from '../../components/Button';
import { MobileButtonStyles } from '../styles/Button';

export default function MobileButton(props) {
  return (
    <MobileButtonStyles>
      <Button {...props} />
    </MobileButtonStyles>
  );
}
```

### Gradual Migration

- Move one component/page at a time
- Test thoroughly after each move
- Update imports immediately after moving
- Commit each logical group of changes

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Backward Compatibility

- Ensure existing functionality isn't broken
- Test all features after each move
- Keep temporary import aliases if needed during transition

### Styling Conflicts

- Watch for CSS conflicts between desktop/mobile styles
- Use platform-specific style overrides when needed
- Maintain consistent design system

### Testing Requirements

- Test moved components on both desktop and mobile
- Verify all import paths work correctly
- Check that styling remains consistent
- Test responsive behavior

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] All shared components accessible from both desktop and mobile
- [ ] Clear separation between platform-specific and shared code
- [ ] No broken imports or missing dependencies
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Improved code organization and reusability
- [ ] Easier to maintain and extend platform-specific features
