# Carp.School Development Progress Tracker

## üìã How to Use This File

### Guidelines for Progress Entries

1. **Check off completed todo files** using `- [x]` when fully complete
2. **Add commit entries** for each significant milestone in a todo file
3. **Use full git commit hashes** (not shortened versions)
4. **Write descriptive commit descriptions** that explain the impact
5. **Update regularly** as work progresses on each todo file

### Commit Entry Format

```markdown
**Commits:**
- `abc1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456` - Brief description of what was accomplished
- `def9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba987654` - Another commit description
```

### Progress Status Icons
