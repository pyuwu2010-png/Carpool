This implementation adds **complete multi-school support** to CarpSchool, allowing multiple educational institutions to use the platform with **complete data isolation**.

## 🎯 Key Features
- ✅ **School-based data isolation** (users only see their school's data)
- ✅ **Auto-detection from email domains** (@sfu.ca → Simon Fraser University)
- ✅ **Admin can manage multiple schools**
- ✅ **Beautiful school selection UI**
- ✅ **Migration support for existing data**

## 📁 New Files Created

### Backend (API)
```

imports/api/ride/
└── RideSchoolMethods.js          # Example school-aware ride methods
```

└── SchoolSelector.jsx            # School selection component

imports/ui/styles/
└── SchoolSelector.js             # Styled components for school selector
```

### Migration
```
server/migrations/
└── addSchoolSupport.js           # Data migration script
```

## 🔧 Modified Files

### Schema Updates
- **`imports/api/ride/Rides.js`** - Added `schoolId` field
- **`imports/api/places/Places.js`** - Added `schoolId` field
- **Users collection** - Added `schoolId` field via AccountsHandlers

### Server Configuration
- **`server/main.js`** - Added school imports and publications

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### 1. Run Migration (Required for existing apps)
```javascript
// In Meteor shell:
import './server/migrations/addSchoolSupport.js'
await migrateToSchoolSupport()
```

### 2. Create Your Schools
```javascript
// Example: Create your actual schools
await Meteor.callAsync('schools.create', {
  name: "Simon Fraser University",
  shortName: "SFU", 
  code: "SFU",
  domain: "sfu.ca",
  location: {
    city: "Burnaby",
    province: "BC",
    country: "Canada"
  }
});
```

### 3. Update Registration Flow
Replace your registration form to include `SchoolSelector`:

```jsx
import SchoolSelector from '../components/SchoolSelector';

// In your registration component:
<SchoolSelector
  userEmail={this.state.email}
  onSchoolSelect={(schoolId, school) => {
    this.setState({ selectedSchoolId: schoolId });
  }}
/>
```

### 4. Update Existing Methods
Replace your existing ride/place methods with school-aware versions:

```javascript
// Old way:
Meteor.call('rides.create', rideData, callback);

// New way (school-aware):
Meteor.call('rides.create.school', rideData, callback);
```

## 📊 Data Structure

### Schools Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: "schoolId123",
  name: "Simon Fraser University",
  shortName: "SFU",
  code: "SFU", 
  domain: "sfu.ca",
  location: {
    city: "Burnaby",
    province: "BC", 
    country: "Canada"
  },
  settings: {
    allowPublicRegistration: true,
    requireEmailVerification: true,
    requireDomainMatch: false
  },
  isActive: true
}
```

### Updated User Document
```javascript
{
  _id: "userId123",
  emails: [...],
  profile: {...},
  roles: [...],
  schoolId: "schoolId123" // NEW FIELD
}
```

### Updated Ride Document  
```javascript
{
  _id: "rideId123",
  schoolId: "schoolId123", // NEW FIELD
  driver: "userId123",
  riders: [...],
  origin: "placeId123",
  destination: "placeId456",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### Data Isolation
- **Users** can only see rides/places from their school
- **Admins** can access all schools
- **School validation** on all operations

### Email Domain Verification
```javascript
// Schools can require matching email domains
settings: {
  requireDomainMatch: true // Only @sfu.ca emails can join SFU
}
```

## 🎨 User Experience

### Registration Flow
1. **User enters email** → Auto-detects school from domain
2. **Manual school selection** → Beautiful searchable list
3. **Domain validation** → Ensures user belongs to school
4. **Account creation** → Automatically assigned to school

### Data Access
- **Rides page** → Only shows rides from user's school
- **Places** → Only school-specific locations
- **Chat** → Only with students from same school

## 🍜 Benefits

### For Students
- ✅ **School-specific content** (only see relevant rides)
- ✅ **Trusted community** (verified school members)
- ✅ **Local focus** (campus-specific locations)

### For Administrators  
- ✅ **Easy multi-school management**
- ✅ **School-specific analytics**
- ✅ **Scalable architecture**

### For CarpSchool Platform
- 🚀 **Massive scalability** (unlimited schools)
- 🏫 **B2B opportunities** (sell to universities)
- 📈 **Network effects** (more schools = more value)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** to your development environment
2. **Run the migration** script to convert existing data
3. **Create your actual schools** (replace the default one)
4. **Test the registration flow** with school selection
5. **Update your UI** to show school context
6. **Add school branding** (logos, colors per school)
