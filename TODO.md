# TODO

[ ] - IMPORTANT: fix how captcha are being validated on client-side.

my idea to fix this is to return a work completion id if the captcha is valid, and that needed to be sent to the sever to verify, that you actually completed the captcha.

[ ] - Implement the `accounts.email.send.verification` method in `AccountsMethods.js`.
[ ] - Add school regions
